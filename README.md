LED Blinking PCB Project (KiCad + Proteus)

This project demonstrates a simple LED blinking circuit. The circuit was designed in KiCad, and its behavior was simulated in Proteus.



 Tools Used
- KiCad 7 (PCB design)
- Proteus 8 (Simulation)
- Laptop camera (for simulation recording)

 Project Files
- schematic.pdf: The circuit schematic
- pcb_layout.png: Screenshot of PCB layout
- simulation.mp4: LED blinking simulation
- KiCad_Files/: Contains .sch, .kicad_pcb, and other files
- Proteus_Files/: Contains .DSN and simulation files



 What I Learned
- Drawing and routing in KiCad
- Simulating LED circuits in Proteus
- Documenting projects for a public portfolio



 What’s Next?
I plan to fabricate the board and build a real-world version for testing.
